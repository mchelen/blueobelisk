CHEMICAL TEST FILE REPOSITORY
-----------------------------

This goal of this project is to set up a large repository of mutually orthogonal chemical
test files to increase interoperability between chemical software.

orthogonal
----------

The project will not contain test files that duplicate test space. The axes in this
space are:
- MIME type
- producing software name
- producing software version
- valid or invalid
- license
- file format constructs

For example, two valid chemical/x-mdl-molfiles produced with the same version of the same
program having the same license are *not* orthogonal, and will not add new testable
data. However, if the second file has a different license, or was produced by another
program, or a different version of the same program, then the file is called 'orthogonal'.
Additionally, if one file contains certain constructs that the other does not, then they
are orthogonal too.

THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE CTFR
----------------------------

The repository organizes the test files according to this scheme:

<MIME>[/SUBTYPE]/[valid|invalid]

where each directory contains one index.xml file providing metadata for that directories
content.

VALIDATION OF INDEX.XML
-----------------------

Validation of the index.xml files is easily done with xmllint against the schema.relaxng.

To validate one file run:

  xmllint --noout --relaxng schema.relaxng index.xml

To validate them all in one go, run:

find . -name index.xml | grep -v .svn | xargs xmllint --noout --relaxng schema.relaxng
