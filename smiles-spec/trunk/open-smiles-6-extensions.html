<a name="6"></a><h2>6. Proposed Extensions</h2>

<a name="6.1"></a><h3>6.1 External R-Groups</h3>

<p>Daylight proposed, and OpenEye actually implemented, an extension that
specifies bonds to external R-groups.  An external R-group is specified
using ampersand '&amp;' followed by a ring-closure specification (either a
digit, or % and two digits).  However, unlike ring-closures, the bond is to
an external, unspecified R-group.  Example: "n1c(&1)c(&2)cccc1" - 2,3-substituted pyridine.</p>

<a name="6.2"></a><h3>6.2 Polymers and Crystals</h3>

<p>Daylight (Weininger) proposed, but never implemented, an extension for crystals and
polymers.  Daylight also used the ampersand '&amp;' character, (which may
conflict with the R-group proposal, above), but with the added rule that 
if a number appears more than once, it creates a repeating unit.

<table class="et">
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> c1ccccc1C&1&1 </td> <td class="ec"> polystyrene </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> C&1&1&1&1     </td> <td class="ec"> diamond     </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> c&1&1&1       </td> <td class="ec"> graphite    </td> </tr>
</table>

<a name="6.3"></a><h3>6.3 '@' for Cis/Trans around Double Bonds</h3>

<p>The '/' and '\' marks for cis/trans bonds seem simple on the surface but
are problematic for complex systems.  For example, in a long series of
conjugated double bonds, changing the configuration of one bond can require
rewriting dozens of bond symbols.</p>

<p>More importantly, there is a theoretical flaw with the use of '/' and
'\'.  In a cyclo-ene (<i>name??</i>) ring with an even number of double bonds, it is
not possible to write a valid SMILES.  (Recall that '/' and '\' reverse
sense if moved from the left to the right of the atom, thus "C/1=C/CCCCCCC1"
represents a cis configuration even though '/' appears twice.)

<table class="et">
  <tr><td class="ec"><img src="cyclooctatetraene.gif"><td class="ecbc"> C/1=C/C=C\C=C/C=C\1 </td> <td class="ec"> Illegal SMILES </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>The SMILES above is illegal because the first and second "C1" have
opposite bond symbols '/' versus '\', so the single bond that was "broken"
to create the ring has to be both "up" and "down".  This logical
flaw follows from using "up" and "down" in a linear notation, when in
fact the atoms form a circle.</p>

<p>The proposed syntax for cis/trans configurations uses the '@' symbol on
the allenal atoms.  For example:

<table class="et">
  <tr>
    <td class="ec"><img src="trans-difluoroethene.gif"></td>
    <td class="ecbc"> F[C@@H]=[C@H]F<br>F[C@H]=[C@@H]F  </td>
    <td class="ec"> trans-difluoroethene</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="ec"><img src="cis-difluoroethene.gif"></td>
    <td class="ecbc"> F[C@H]=[C@H]F<br>F[C@@H]=[C@@H]F</td>
    <td class="ec"> cis-difluoroethene</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Interpretation of '@' and '@@' follows the tetrahedral convention:
The atoms, as encountered in the SMILES string, are either in anticlockwise
'@' or clockwise '@@' order as viewed on the page.  Since cis/trans
configurations are planar, they can also be "viewed from underneath the
page", which results in the two valid SMILES shown for each compound,
above.</p>

<p>Note that in all cases, cis and trans are easy for the chemist to
distinguish visually: A trans form always has opposite "clock-ness" (@,@@ or
@@,@), and the cis form always has the same "clock-ness" (@,@ or @@,@@) for
the allenal atoms.</p>

<p>This proposed form of cis/trans specification using '@' and '@@' does not suffer from the
theoretical flaw illustrated above:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr><td class="ec"><img src="cyclooctatetraene.gif"><td class="ecbc"> [C@H]1=[C@@H][C@@H]=[C@@H][C@@H]=[C@@H][C@@H]=[C@@H]1 </td> <td class="ec"> cyclooctatetraene </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>Note that the first allenal carbon must be represented as '@' since the
'1' follows the H, whereas the rest of the allenal carbons use '@@' to
characterize the cis configuration of each bond.  Since this is a
specification on the atom, rather than the single bond, no conflict arises
at the ring-closure bond.</p>

<a name="6.5"></a><h3>6.5 Radicals</h3>

<p><i>This section needs considerable work.  The following text is courtesy Chris Morley, who
commented: "I guess the last paragraph doesn't look too good in a formal specification. There are
two reasons for the frailty: lack of proof that the radical and aromatic uses can always be
unambigous (I doubt anybody has tried); and a known deficiency in the parser."  However, it is a
good starting point...</i></p>

<p>A single lowercase symbol is interpreted as a radical center. CCc is an alternative to CC[CH2] and
is the 1-propyl radical; CcC or C[CH]C is the 2-propyl radical, Co is the methoxy radical. An odd
number of adjacent lowercase symbols is a delocalised conjugated radical. So Cccccc is CC=CC=C[CH2]
or CC=C[CH]C=C or C[CH]C=CC=C Lowercase "c" or "n" can be used in a ring: C1cCCCC1 is the cyclohexyl
radical.</p>

<p>The use of the non-aromatic lowercase symbol is a shorted form with improved intelligibilty that
allows the use of implicit hydrogen in radicals. However it is intended only for simple unambiguous
molecules and is not reliable when combined with aromatic atoms.</p>

<a name="6.6"></a><h3>6.6 Twisted SMILES</h3>

<p>An interesting extension that specifies conformational information via
bond dihedral angles and bond lengths was proposed by McLeod and Peters:
