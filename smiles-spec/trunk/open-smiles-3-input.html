<a name="3"></a><h2>3. Reading SMILES</h2>


<a name="3.1"></a><h3>3.1 Atoms</h3>


<a name="3.1.1"></a><h4>3.1.1 Atomic Symbol</h4>

<p>An atom is represented by its atomic symbol, enclosed in square brackets, <span class="sm">[
]</span>.  The first character of the symbol is uppercase and the second (if any) is lowercase,
except that for aromatic atoms (see below), the first character is lowercase.  There are <a
href="http://www.iupac.org/reports/provisional/abstract04/RB-prs310804/TableI-3.04.pdf"> 111 valid
atomic symbols</a>, as defined by <a href="http://www.iupac.org">IUPAC</a> (see also <a
href="http://www.webelements.com">Web Elements</a>).</p>

<p>The symbol '*' is also accepted as a valid atomic symbol, and represents a "wildcard" or unknown atom.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [U]  </td> <td class="ec"> Uranium </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [Pb] </td> <td class="ec"> Lead    </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [He] </td> <td class="ec"> Helium  </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [*]  </td> <td class="ec"> Unknown atom  </td> </tr>
</table>


<a name="3.1.2"></a><h4>3.1.2 Hydrogens</h4>

<p>Hydrogens inside of brackets are specified as "Hn" where "n" is a number such as "H3".  If no
"Hn" is specified, it is identical to <span class="sm">H0</span>. If <span class="sm">H</span> is
specified without a number, it is identical to <span class="sm">H1</span>.  For example, <span class="sm">[C]</span> and
<span class="sm">[CH0]</span> are identical, and <span class="sm">[CH]</span> and <span
class="sm">[CH1]</span> are identical.</p>

<p>Hydrogens that are specified in brackets with this notation have undefined isotope, no chirality,
no other bound hydrogen, neutral charge, and an undefined atom class.</p>


<p>Examples:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [CH4]  </td> <td class="ec"> methane           </td> <td class="ec"> &nbsp;</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [ClH]  </td> <td class="ec"> hydrochloric acid </td> <td class="ec"> H1 implied </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [ClH1] </td> <td class="ec"> hydrochloric acid </td> <td class="ec"> &nbsp </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>A hydrogen atom cannot have a hydrogen count, for example, [HH1] is illegal.  Hydrogens connected
to other hydrogens must be represented as explicit atoms in square brackets. For example molecular
hydrogen must be written as <span class="sm">[H][H]</span>.

<p><i>Question: are more than 9 hydrogens possible?  Should they be
supported?</i></p>


<a name="3.1.3"></a><h4>3.1.3 Charge</h4>

<p>Charge is specified by a "+n" or "-n" where "n" is a number; if the
number is missing, it means either +1 or -1 as appropriate.</p>


<p>For backwards compatibility, a general-purpose SMILES parser should
accept the symbols "--" and "++" to mean charges of -2 and +2, but this
is a deprecated form and should be avoided.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [Cl-]  </td> <td class="ec"> chloride anion    </td> <td class="ec"> -1 charge, H0 implied </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [OH1-] </td> <td class="ec"> hydroxyl anion    </td> <td class="ec"> -1 charge, H1 </td></tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [OH-1] </td> <td class="ec"> hydroxyl anion    </td> <td class="ec"> -1 charge, H1 </td></tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [Cu+2] </td> <td class="ec"> copper cation     </td> <td class="ec"> +2 charge, H0 implied </td></tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [Cu++] </td> <td class="ec"> copper cation     </td> <td class="ec"> +2 charge, H0 implied (deprecated form)</td></tr>
</table>

<p><i>Question: do we need to allow two-digit charges, like "+10"?</i></p>


<a name="3.1.4"></a><h4>3.1.4 Isotopes</h4>

<p>Isotopic specification is placed inside the square brackets for an atom
preceeding the atomic symbol; for example:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [13CH4] </td> <td class="ec"> methane-<sup>13</sup>C </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [2H+]   </td> <td class="ec"> deuterium ion </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [238U]  </td> <td class="ec"> uranium 238 atom </td> </tr>
</table>


<p>An isotope is interpreted as a number, so that <span class="sm">[2H]</span>, <span
class="sm">[02H]</span> and <span class="sm">[002H]</span> all mean deuterium.  If the isotope field
is not specified then the atom is assumed to have the naturally-occuring isotopic ratios.  The
isotope value <span class="sm">0</span> also indicates an isotope of zero, that is <span
class="sm">[0S]</span> is <i>not</i> the same as <span class="sm">[S]</span>.</p>

<p>There is no requirement that the isotope is a genuine isotope of the element.  Thus, <span
class="sm">[36Cl]</span> is allowed even though <sup>35</sup>Cl and
<sup>37</sup>Cl are the actual known stable isotopes of chlorine.</p>

<p>A general-purpose SMILES parser must accept at least three digits for the isotope and values
from <span class="sm">0</span> to <span class="sm">999</span>.</p>


<a name="3.1.5"></a><h4>3.1.5 "Organic Subset" Elements</h4>

<p>A special subset of elements called the "organic subset" of
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>N</b>,<b>O</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>F</b>,
<b>Cl</b>, <b>Br</b>, <b>I</b>, and <b>*</b> (the "wildcard" atom) can be
written using the only the atomic symbol (that is, without the square
brackets, H-count, etc.).  An atom is specified this way has the
following properties:</p>

<ul>

  <li>"implicit hydrogens" are added such that valence of the atom is in
  the lowest normal state for that element</li>
  <li>the atom's charge is zero</li>
  <li>the atom has no isotopic specification</li>
  <li>the atom has no chiral specification</li>
</ul>

<p>The implicit hydrogen count is determined by summing the bond orders
of the bonds connected to the atom.  If that sum is equal to a known
valence for the element or is greater than any known valence then the
implicit hydrogen count is 0.  Otherwise the implicit hydrogen count is the
difference between that sum and the next highest known valence.</p>

<p>The "normal valence" for these elements is defined as:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr><td class="ect"> Element </td> <td class="ect"> Valence </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> B </td> <td class="ec"> 3 </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> C </td> <td class="ec"> 4 </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> N </td> <td class="ec"> 3 or 5 </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> O </td> <td class="ec"> 2 </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> P </td> <td class="ec"> 3 or 5 </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> S </td> <td class="ec"> 2, 4, or 6 </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> halogens </td> <td class="ec"> 1 </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> * </td> <td class="ec"> unspecified </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>Examples:<p>

<table class="et">
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> C  </td> <td class="ec"> methane </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> N  </td> <td class="ec"> ammonia </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> Cl </td> <td class="ec"> hydrochloric acid </td> </tr>
</table>

<p><i>Note: The remaining atom properties, chirality and ring-closures, are discussed in later sections.</i></p>

<a name="3.1.6"></a><h4>3.1.6 The Wildcard '*' Atomic Symbol</h4>

<p>The '*' atom represents an atom whose atomic number is unknown or unspecified.  If it occurs
inside brackets, it can have its isotope, chirality, hydrogen count and charge specified.  If it
occurs outside of brackets, it has no assumed isotope, a mass of zero, unspecified chirality, a
hydrogen count of zero, and a charge of zero.</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> Oc1(*)ccccc1  </td> <td class="ec"> ortho-substituted phenol </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>The '*' atom does not have any specific electronic properties or
valence.  If specified outside of square brackets, it takes on the valence
implied by its bonds.  If it is inside square brackets, it takes on the
valence implied by its bonds, hydrogens and/or charge.</p>

<p>A '*' atom can be part of an aromatic ring.  When deducing the
aromaticity of a ring system, the ring system is considered aromatic if
there is an element which could replace the '*' and make the ring system
meet the aromaticity rules (see <a href="#3.5">aromaticity</a>, below).

<a name="3.1.7"></a><h4>3.1.7 Atom Class</h4>

<p>An "atom class" is an arbitrary integer, a number that has no chemical
meaning.  It is used by applications to mark atoms in ways that are
meaningful only to the application.  Multiple atoms may be labeled with the
same atom class.</p>

<p>The atom class is specified after all other properties in square brackets.  For example:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [CH4:2]</td> <td class="ec"> methane, atom's class is 2 </td> </tr>
</table>


<p>If the atom class is not specified then the atom class is zero.
The atom class is interpreted as a number, so both "[CH2:5]"
and "[NH4+:005]" have an atom class of 5.</p>

<a name="3.2"></a><h3>3.2 Bonds</h3>

<p>Atoms that are adjacent in a SMILES string are assumed to
be joined by a single or aromatic bond (see <a href="#3.5">aromaticity</a>).  For example:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> CC    </td> <td class="ec"> ethane </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> CCO   </td> <td class="ec"> ethanol </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> NCCCC </td> <td class="ec"> n-butylamine </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> CCCCN </td> <td class="ec"> n-butylamine </td> </tr>
</Table>

<p>Double, triple and quadruple bonds are represented by '=', '#', and '$' respectively:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> C=C   </td> <td class="ec"> ethene </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> C#N   </td> <td class="ec"> hydrogen cyanide </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> CC#CC </td> <td class="ec"> 2-Butyne </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> CCC=O </td> <td class="ec"> propanal </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [Rh-](Cl)(Cl)(Cl)(Cl)$[Rh-](Cl)(Cl)(Cl)Cl </td> <td class="ec"> octachlorodirhenate (III) </td></tr>
</table>

<p>A single bond can be explicitely represented with '-', but it is rarely
necessary.<p>

<table class="et">
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> C-C     </td> <td class="ec"> same as: CC </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> C-C-O   </td> <td class="ec"> same as: CCO </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> C-C=C-C </td> <td class="ec"> same as: CC=CC </td> </tr>
</table>

<p><i>Note: The remaining bond symbols, </i>"<tt>:\/</tt>"<i>, are discussed in
later sections.</i></p>


<a name="3.3"></a><h3>3.3 Branches</h3>

<p>An atom with three or more bonds is called a <i>branched atom</i>, and is
represented using parentheses.</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="2-ethyl-1-butanol.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> CCC(CC)CO </td> <td class="ec"> 2-Ethyl-1-butanol     </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>Branches can be nested or "stacked" to any depth:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="2-4-dimethyl-3-pentanone.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> CC(C)C(=O)C(C)C </td> <td class="ec"> 2,4-dimethyl-3-pentanone</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ec">pic here<img src=""></td> <td class="ecbc"> OCC(CCC)C(C(C)C)CCC </td> <td class="ec"> 2-propyl-3-isopropyl-1-propanol </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="thiosulfate.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> OS(=O)(=S)O </td> <td class="ec"> thiosulfate </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>The SMILES branch/chain rules allow nested parenthetical expressions (branches) to an arbitrary
depth.  For example, the following SMILES, though peculiar, is legal:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ecbc">C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C))))))))))))))))))))C</td><td class="ec">C22H46</td> </tr>
</table>
</p>


<a name="3.4"></a><h3>3.4 Rings</h3>

<p>In a SMILES string such as "C1CCCCC1", the first occurance of a ring-closure
number (an "rnum") creates an "open bond" to the atom that preceeds the
ring-closure number (the "rnum").  When that same rnum is encountered
later in the string, a bond is made between the two atoms, which typically
forms a cyclic structure.</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="cyclohexane.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> C1CCCCC1 </td> <td class="ec"> cyclohexane</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="perhydroisoquinoline.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> N1CC2CCCC2CC1 </td> <td class="ec"> perhydroisoquinoline </td> </tr>
</table>

<p> If a bond symbol is present between the atom and rnum, it can be
present on <i>either or both</i> bonded atoms.  However, if it appears on
both bonded atoms, the two bond symbols must be the same.</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td rowspan="3" class="ec"><img src="cyclohexane.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> C=1CCCCC=1 </td> <td class="ec"> cyclohexene</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> C=1CCCC1   </td> <td class="ec">  cyclohexene <i>(preferred form)</i> </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> C1CCCC=1   </td> <td class="ec">  cyclohexene </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ec">&nbsp;</td> <td class="ecbc"> C-1CCCC=1  </td> <td class="ec"> <i>invalid</i> </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>Ring closures must be matched pairs in a SMILES string, for example, "C1CCC"
is not a valid SMILES.</p>

<p>It is permissable to re-use ring-closure numbers.  Once a particular number
has been encountered twice, that number is available again for subsequent ring closures.<p>

<table class="et">
  <tr>
    <td class="ec" rowspan="2"><img src="dicyclohexyl.gif"></td>
    <td class="ecbc">
      C1CCCCC1C1CCCCC1
    </td>
     <td class="ec">
      dicyclohexyl
    </td>
    <td class="ec" rowspan="2">both SMILES are valid</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="ecbc">
      C1CCCCC1C2CCCCC2
    </td>
    <td class="ec">
      dicyclohexyl
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Note that the ring number zero is valid, for example cyclohexane can be
written "C0CCCCC0".<p>

<p>Two-digit ring numbers are permitted, but must be preceeded by the percent
"%" symbol, such as "C%25CCCCC%25" for cyclohexane. Three-digit numbers and
larger are never permitted.  However, note that three digits are not invalid; for
example, "C%123" is the same as "C3%12", that is, an atom with two rnum
specifications.</p>

<p>The digit(s) representing a ring-closure are interpreted as a number, not a
symbol, and two rnums match if their numbers match.  Thus, C1CCCCC%01 is a
valid SMILES and is the same as C1CCCCC1.  Likewise, C%00CCCCC%00 is a
valid SMILES.</p>

<p>A single atom can have several ring-closure numbers, such as this spiro
atom:<p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="spiro.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> C12(CCCCC1)CCCCC2 </td> <td class="ec"> spiro[5.5]undecane </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>Two atoms cannot be joined by more than one bond, and an atom cannot be bonded to itself.  For
example, the following are not allowed:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> C12CCCCC12 </td> <td class="ec"> <i>illegal, two bonds between one pair of atoms</i></td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> C12C2CCC1  </td> <td class="ec"> <i>illegal, two bonds between one pair of atoms</i></td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> C11        </td> <td class="ec"> <i>illegal, atom bonded to itself</i></td> </tr>
</table>


<a name="3.5"></a><h3>3.5 Aromaticity</h3>

<p>Aromaticity can be represented in one of two ways in a SMILES.<p>

<ul>
  <li>In the Kekul&eacute; form, using alternating single and double bonds, with
      uppercase symbols for the atoms.</li>
  <li>An atomic symbol that begins with a lowercase letter is an aromatic atom, such as 'c' 
      for aromatic carbon.  When aromatic symbols are used, no bond symbols are needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>A lowercase aromatic symbol is defined as an atom in the sp<sup>2</sup> configuration in an
aromatic or anti-aromatic ring system.  For example:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="benzene.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> c1ccccc1<br>C1=CC=CC=C1 </td> <td class="ec"> benzene </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="indane.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> c1ccc2CCCc2c1<br>C1=CC=CC(CCC2)=C12 </td> <td class="ec"> indane </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="furan.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> c1occc1<br>C1OC=CC=C1<br> </td> <td class="ec"> furan </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="cyclobutadiene.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> c1ccc1<br>C1=CC=C1<br> </td> <td class="ec"> cyclobutadiene </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>The Kekul&eacute; form is always acceptable for SMILES input.  For output, the aromatic form
(using lowercase letters) <a href="open-smiles-4-output.html#4.3.5">is preferred</a>.  The lowercase
symbols eliminate the arbitrary choice of how to assign the single and double bonds, and provide a
<a href="#4">normalized form</a> that more accurately reflects the electronic configuration.</p>

<p>In an aromatic system, all of the aromatic atoms must be sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized, and the
number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_electron" title="Pi_electron">Pi electrons</a>
must meet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCckel's_rule">H&uuml;ckel's 4N+2
criterion</a>. When parsing a SMILES, a parser must note the aromatic designation of each atom on
input, then when the parsing is complete, the SMILES software must verify that electrons can be
assigned without violating the valence rules, consistent with the sp<sup>2</sup> markings, the
specified or implied hydrogens, external bonds, and charges on the atoms.</p>

<p>The aromatic-bond symbol ':' can be used between aromatic atoms, but it is never necessary; a
bond between two aromatic atoms is assumed to be aromatic unless it is explicitely represented as a
single bond '-'.  However, a single bond (nonaromatic bond) between two aromatic atoms <i>must</i>
be explicitely represented.  For example:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="biphenyl.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> c1ccccc1-c2ccccc2 </td> <td class="ec"> biphenyl </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>This meaning of <i>aromaticity</i> for SMILES is strictly for
<a href="http://www.emolecules.com/doc/cheminformatics-101.htm">cheminformatics</a> purposes.  It is
<i>not</i> intended to imply anything about the physical or chemical properties of a substance.  In
many or most cases, the SMILES definition of aromaticity will match the chemist's notion of what is
aromatic, but in some cases it will not.  The SMILES definition of aromaticity is designed to
facilitate <a href="#4">normalization</a> of SMILES, not to predict chemical properties.
</p>

<p><i>Note: Some SMILES parsers interpret a lowercase letter as sp<sup>2</sup> anywhere it appears;
for example, <span class="sm">CccccC</span> would be interpreted as <span
class="sm">CC=CC=CC</span>.  The OpenSMILES specification does not allow this interpretation unless
<a href="open-smiles-5-nonstandard.html">nonstandard parsing</a> is explicitely allowed by the
user.</i></p>


<a name="3.6"></a><h3>3.6 More about Hydrogen</h3>

<p>Hydrogens in a SMILES can be represented in three different ways:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr>
    <td class="ec">   implicit hydrogen </td>
    <td class="ecbc"> C </td>
    <td class="ec">   methane </td>
    <td class="ec">   h-count deduced from normal valence (4)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="ec">   atom property </td>
    <td class="ecbc"> [CH4] </td>
    <td class="ec">   methane </td>
    <td class="ec">   h-count specified for heavy atom</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="ec">   explicit hydrogens </td>
    <td class="ecbc"> [H]C([H])([H])[H] </td>
    <td class="ec">   methane </td>
    <td class="ec">   hydrogens represented as normal atoms</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>All three forms are equivalent.  However, some situations require that one form must be used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Implicit hydrogen count may only be used for elements of the <a href="#3.1.5">organic elements</a> subset.</li>
  <li>Any atom that is specified with square brackets <i>must</i> have its attached hydrogens 
      explicitely represented, either as a hydrogen count or as normal atoms.</li>
</ul>

<p>A hydrogen that meets one of the following criteria must be represented as an explicit atom:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hydrogens with charge ([H+])</li>
  <li>a hydrogen connected to another hydrogen (such as molecular hydrogen, [H][H])</li>
  <li>hydrogens with more than one bond (bridging hydrogens)</li>
  <li>Deuterium [2H] and tritium [3H]</li>
</ul>

<p>It is permissible to use a mixture of an atom h-count and explicit hydrogen.  In such a case,
the atom's hydrogen count is the sum of the atomic h-count property and the number of attached
hydrogens.  For example:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> [CH4]       </td> <td class="ec"> methane </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> [H][CH2][H] </td> <td class="ec"> methane </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> [2H][CH3]C  </td> <td class="ec"> deuteroethane </td> </tr>
</table>


<a name="3.7"></a><h3>3.7 Disconnected Structures</h3>

<p>The dot '.' symbol (also called a "dot bond") is legal most places where
a bond symbol would occur, but indicates that the atoms are <i>not</i>
bonded.  The most common use of the dot-bond symbol is to represent
disconnected and ionic compounds.</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="sodium-chloride.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> [Na+].[Cl-]  </td> <td class="ec">  sodium chloride </td></tr>
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="phenol-2-amino-ethanol.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> Oc1ccccc1.NCCO   </td> <td class="ec"> phenol, 2-amino ethanol  </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="diammonium-thiosulfate.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> [NH4+].[NH4+].[O-]S(=O)(=O)[S-]      </td> <td class="ec"> diammonium thiosulfate </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>The dot can appear most places that a bond symbol is allowed, for example, the phenol example above
can also be written:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ec" rowspan="2"><img src="phenol-2-amino-ethanol.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> c1cc(O.NCCO)ccc1   </td> <td class="ec"> phenol, 2-amino ethanol  </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> Oc1cc(.NCCO)ccc1   </td> <td class="ec"> phenol, 2-amino ethanol  </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>The second example above is an odd, but legal, use of parentheses and the dot bond, since the
syntax allows a dot most places a regular bond could appear (the exception
is that a dot can't appear before a ring-closure digit).</p>

<p>Although dot-bonds are commonly used to represent compounds with disconnected parts, a dot-bond
does <i>not</i> in itself mean that there are disconnected parts in the compound.   See the
following section regarding ring digits for some examples that illustrate this.<p>

<p>The dot bond cannot be used in front of a ring-closure digit.  For example, <span
class="sm">C.1CCCCC.1</span> is illegal.</p>

<a name="3.8"></a><h3>3.8 Other Uses of Ring Numbers and Dot Bond</h3>

<p>A ring-number specifications ("rnum") is most commonly used to specify a ring-closure bond, but
when used with the "." dot-bond symbol, it can also specify a non-ring bond.  Two rnums in a SMILES
mean that the two atoms that preceed the rnums are bonded.  A dot-bond "." means that the atoms to
which it is adjacent in the SMILES string are <i>not</i> bonded to each other.  By combining these
two constructs, one can "piece together" fragments of SMILES into a whole molecule.  The following
SMILES illustrate this:
</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ec" align="center"> CC </td> <td class="ecbc"> C1.C1  </td> <td class="ec"> ethane </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ec" align="center"> CCC </td> <td class="ecbc"> C1.C12.C2  </td> <td class="ec"> propane</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="1-bromo-2-3-dichlorobenzene.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> c1c2c3c4cc1.Br2.Cl3.Cl4  </td> <td class="ec"> 1-bromo-2,3-dichlorobenzene </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>This feature of SMILES provides a convenient method of enumerating the
molecules of a combinatorial library using string concatenation.</p>

<a name="3.9"></a><h3>3.9 Stereochemistry</h2>

<a name="3.9.1"></a><h4>3.9.1 Scope of Stereochemistry in SMILES</h4>

<p>A SMILES string can specify the cis/trans configuration around a double bond,
and can specify the chiral configuration of specific atoms in a molecule.</p>

<p>SMILES strings do <i>not</i> represent all types of stereochemistry.  Examples of
stereochemistry that cannot be encoded into a SMILES include:

<ul>
  <li>Gross conformational left or right handedness such as helicenes</li>
  <li>Mechanical interferences, such as rotatable bonds that are
  constrained by mechanical interferences</li>
  <li>Gross conformational stereochemistry such as the shape of a protein after folding</li>
</ul>


<a name="3.9.2"></a><h4>3.9.2 Tetrahedral Centers</h4>

<p>SMILES uses an atom-centered chirality specification, in which the atom's left-to-right order in
the SMILES string itself is used as the basis for the chirality marking.

<table class="et">
  <tr><td class="ec" align="center" colspan="2"><b>Tetrahedral Chirality</b></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="ec">look from N toward C (chiral center)...</td>
    <td class="ec"> list the neighbors anticlockwise</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="ec"   rowspan="3" align="center"><img src="tetrahedral.gif"></td>
    <td class="ecbc" align="center">N[C@](Br)(O)C</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="ec"> ...or clockwise</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="ecbc" align="center">N[C@@](Br)(C)O</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>For the structure above, starting with the nitrogen atom, one "looks" toward the chiral
center. The the remaining three neighbor atoms are written by listing them in anticlockwise order using the '@'
chiral property on the atom, or in clockwise order using the '@@' chiral property, as illustrated
above.  The '@' symbol is a "visual mnemonic" in that the spiral around the character goes in the
anticlockwise direction, and means "anticlockwise" in the SMILES string (thus, '@@' can be thought of
as anti-anti-clockwise).<p>

<p>A chiral center can be written starting from any of its neighbor atoms, and the choice of
whether to list the remaining neighbor in clockwise or anticlockwise order is also arbitrary.  The
following SMILES are all equivalent and all specify the exact same chiral center illustrated above:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> N[C@](Br)(O)C  </td> <td class="ecbc"> Br[C@](O)(N)C </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> O[C@](Br)(C)N  </td> <td class="ecbc"> Br[C@](C)(O)N </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> C[C@](Br)(N)O  </td> <td class="ecbc"> Br[C@](N)(C)O </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> C[C@@](Br)(O)N </td> <td class="ecbc"> Br[C@@](N)(O)C </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>If one of the neighbor atoms is a hydrogen and is represented as an atomic property of the
chiral center (rather than explicitely as [H]), then it is considered to be the first atom in the
clockwise or anticlockwise accounting.  For example, if we replaced the bromine in the illustration
above with a hydrogen atom, its SMILES would be:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ecbc">  N[C@H](O)C</td></tr>
</table>

<a name="3.9.3"></a><h4>3.9.3 Cis/Trans configuration of Double Bonds</h4>

<p>The configuration of atoms around double bonds is specified by the bond symbols '/' and '\'.
These symbols always come in pairs, and indicate cis or trans with a visual "same side" or
"opposite side" concept.  That is:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr>
    <td class="ec"><img src="trans-difluoroethene.gif"></td>
    <td class="ecbc"> F/C=C/F<br>F\C=C\F  </td>
    <td class="ec"> trans-difluoroethene<br><i>(both SMILES are equivalent)</i> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="ec"><img src="cis-difluoroethene.gif"></td>
    <td class="ecbc"> F\C=C/F<br>F/C=C\F </td>
    <td class="ec"> cis-difluoroethene<br><i>(both SMILES are equivalent)  </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The "visual interpretation" of the '/' and '\' symbol is that they are thought of as bonds that
"point" above or below the allenal carbon.  That is, "F/C=C/Br" means "The F is below the first carbon,
and the Br is above the second carbon," leading to the interpretation of a trans configuration.

<p>This notation can be confusing when parentheses follow one of the allenal carbons:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr>
    <td class="ecbc">
      F/C=C/F<br>
      C(\F)=C\F
    </td>
    <td class="ec">
      trans-difluoroethene</i>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="ecbc">
      F\C=C/F<br>
      C(/F)=C/F
    </td>
    <td class="ec">
      cis-difluoroethene
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The "visual interpretation" of the "up-ness" or "down-ness" of each single
bond is <i>relative to the carbon atom</i>, not the double bond, so the sense of the symbol changes
when the fluorine atom moved from the left to the right side of the allenal carbon atom.</p>

<p><i>Note: This point was not well documented in earlier SMILES specifications, and several SMILES
interpreters are known to interpret the '/' and '\' symbols incorrectly.</i></p>

<p>A SMILES with conflicting up/down specifications is invalid:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr>
    <td class="ecbc">
      C/C(\F)=C/F
    </td>
    <td class="ec">
      Invalid SMILES: Both the methyl and fluorine are "down" relative to the first allenal carbon.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p>It is permissible, but not required, that every atom attached to a double bond be marked.  As
long as at least two neighbor atoms, one on each end of the double bond, is marked, the "up-ness" or
"down-ness" of the unmarked neighbors can be deduced.</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr>
    <td class="ecbc">
      F/C(C)=C/F
    </td>
    <td class="ec">
      trans-difluoro configuration, position of methyl is implied
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p>Extended cis and trans configurations can be specified for conjugated allenes with an odd number
of double bonds:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> F/C=C=C=C/F  </td> <td class="ec"> trans-difluorobutatriene </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> F/C=C=C=C\F  </td> <td class="ec"> cis-difluorobutatriene </td> </tr>
</table>


<a name="3.9.4"></a><h4>3.9.4 Tetrahedral Allene-like Systems</h4>

<p>Extended tetrahedral configurations can be specified for conjugated allenes with an even number
of double bonds.  The normal tetrahedral rules using '@' and '@@' apply, but the "neighbor" atoms
to which the chirality refers are at the ends of the allenal system.  For example:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="tetrahedral-allene.gif"></td><td class="ecbc"> NC(Br)=[C@]=C(O)C </td> </tr>
</table>
  
<p>To determine the correct clockwise or anticlockwise specification, the allene is conceptually
"collapsed" into a single tetrahedral chiral center, and the resulting chirality is marked as a
property of the center atom of the extended allene system.</p>

<a name="3.9.5"></a><h4>3.9.5 Partial Stereochemistry</h4>

<p>SMILES allows partial stereochemical specifications.  It is permissible for some chiral centers
or double bonds to have stereochemical markings in the SMILES, while others in the same SMILES
string do not.  For example:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> F/C=C/C/C=C\C  </td> <td class="ec"> completely specified  </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> F/C=C/CC=CC  </td> <td class="ec"> partially specified </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> N1[C@H](Cl)[C@@H](Cl)C(Cl)CC1  </td> <td class="ec"> partially specified</td> </tr>
</table>

<a name="3.9.6"></a><h4>3.9.6 Other Chiral Configurations</h4>

<p>The SMILES language supports a number of atom-centered chiral
configurations:</p>
<pre>
   TH	Tetrahedral
   AL	Allenal
   SP   Square Planar
   TB   Trigonal Bipyramidal
   OH   Octahedral
</pre>

<p>The shorthand notations '@' and '@@' correspond to clockwise and
anti-clockwise tetrahedral chirality, and are the same a '@TH1' and
'@TH2', respectively.  Likewise, in an allenal configuration, the shorthand
notations '@' and '@@' correspond to '@AL1' and '@AL2', respectively.</p>

<p>Very few SMILES systems actually implement the rules for SP, TB or OH chirality.</p>

<p><i>NEED COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION for SP, TB and OH.</i></p>

<a name="3.10"></a><h3>3.10 Parsing Termination</h3>

<p>A SMILES string is terminated by a whitespace terminator character (space, tab, newline,
carriage-return), or by the end of the string.</p>

<p>Other data or information, such as a name, properties, registration number, etc., may follow the
SMILES on a line after the whitespace character.  SMILES parsers will ignore this data, although
applications that use the SMILES parser will often make use of it.</p>


<a name="3.11"></a><h3>3.11 Programming Practices</h3>

<p>OpenSMILES is designed to facilitate exchange of chemical information.  To achieve that goal, it
SMILES parsers should impose as few limits as possible on the language.</p>

<p>There is no formal limit to the length of a SMILES string; SMILES of over 1 million characters
have been assembled for various purposes.  There is no requirement that a SMILES parser must be able
to parse these exceptionally long SMILES, but as a guideline, all implementations of SMILES parsers
should, at a minimum, accept and correctly parse SMILES strings of 100,000 characters.  If a SMILES
parser encounters a string that is too long to parse, it should generate a relevant error
message.</p>

<p>A SMILES parser should accept at least four digits for the <a href="#3.1.7">atom class</a>,
and the values 0 to 9999.</p>

<p>There is no formal limit to the number of rings a molecule can contain.  There are only
100 ring-closure numbers, but since numbers can be reused, a molecule can potentially have more
than 100 rings.  SMILES parsers should accept and correctly parse molecules with at least 1000 rings;
it is preferable to place no limits on the number of rings a molecule can contain.</p>

<p>Branches (parentheses) can be nested to an arbitrary depth.  Some SMILES strings in standard
databases contain over 30 levels of branches, and much deeper nesting is possible.  A general
purpose parser must handle at least 100 levels; it is preferrable to place no limits on nesting
depth for parentheses.</p>

<p>There is no formal limit on the number of bonds an atom can have.  SMILES parsers should allow at
least ten bonds to each atom; it is preferrable to place no limits on the number of bonds to each
atom.</p>

<p>There is no limit to the number of "dot-disconnected" fragments in a SMILES.  A SMILES of 100,000
atoms could in principle contain no bonds at all; SMILES parsers should place no limits on the
number of fragments allowed (except that it is limited to the number of atoms the parser can
manage).</p>

<p>Programmers are <i>strongly</i> encouraged to provide detailed and clear error messages.  If
possible, the error message should show exactly which character or "phrase" of the SMILES string
triggered the error message.</p>
