<a name="3"></a><h2>3. Input Specification</h2>


<a name="3.1"></a><h3>3.1 Atoms</h3>


<a name="3.1.1"></a><h4>3.1.1 Atomic Element, Hydrogens, and Charge</h4>

<p>An atom is represented by its atomic symbol, enclosed in square brackets,
[].  The first character of the symbol is uppercase and the second (if any) is
lowercase, except that for aromatic atoms (see below), the first
character is lowercase.</p>

<p>Following the atomic symbol, the atom's hydrogen count and charge can
be specified.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hydrogens are specified as "Hn" where "n" is a number such as "H3"; if
      the number is missing ("H"), it means 1 hydrogen.</li>
  <li>Charge is specified by a "+n" or "-n" where "n" is a number; if the
      number is missing, it means either +1 or -1 as appropriate.</li>
  <li>"++" is a synonym for "+2" and "--" is a synonym for "-2".</li>
</ul>

<p>If no hcount is specified, it is identical to <span class="sm">H0</span>. If  <span
class="sm">H</span> is specified without a number, a count of 1 is implied.  For example,
<span class="sm">[C]</span> and <span class="sm">[CH0]</span> are identical, and 
<span class="sm">[CH]</span> and <span class="sm">[CH1]</span> are identical.</p>

<p>Hydrogens that are specified in brackets with this notation have undefined isotope, no chirality,
no other bound hydrogen, neutral charge, and an undefined atom class.</p>

<p>For backwards compatibility, a general-purpose SMILES parser should
accept the symbols "--" and "++" to mean charges of -2 and +2 but this
is a deprecated form and should be avoided.</p>

<p><i>Question: are more than 9 hydrogens possible?  Should they be
supported?</i></p>

<p><i>Question: do we need to allow two digit charges, like "+10"?</i></p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [CH4]  </td> <td class="ec"> methane           </td> <td class="ec"> zero charge implied</td></tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [ClH]  </td> <td class="ec"> hydrochloric acid </td> <td class="ec"> H1 implied, zero charge implied </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [ClH1] </td> <td class="ec"> hydrochloric acid </td> <td class="ec"> zero charge implied </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [Cl-]  </td> <td class="ec"> chloride anion    </td> <td class="ec"> H0 implied, -1 charge implied </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [OH1-] </td> <td class="ec"> hydroxyl anion    </td> <td class="ec"> -1 charge implied </td></tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [OH-1] </td> <td class="ec"> hydroxyl anion    </td> <td class="ec"> H1 implied </td></tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [Cu+2] </td> <td class="ec"> copper cation     </td> <td class="ec"> H0 implied </td></tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [Cu++] </td> <td class="ec"> copper cation     </td> <td class="ec"> +2 charge, H0 implied </td></tr>
</table>

<p>There are 111 valid atomic symbols defined by <a href="http://www.iupac.org">IUPAC</a> (see also
<a href="http://www.webelements.com">Web Elements</a>).</p>


<a name="3.1.2"></a><h4>3.1.2 Isotopes</h4>

<p>Isotopic specification is placed inside the square brackets for an atom
preceeding the atomic symbol; for example:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [13CH4] </td> <td class="ec"> methane-<sup>13</sup>C </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [2H+]   </td> <td class="ec"> deuterium ion </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> [238U]  </td> <td class="ec"> uranium 238 atom </td> </tr>
</table>


<p>An isotope is interpreted as a number, so that <span class="sm">[2H]</span>, <span
class="sm">[02H]</span> and <span class="sm">[002H]</span> all mean deuterium.  If the isotope field
is not specified then the atom is assumed to have the naturally-occuring isotopic ratios.  The
isotope value <span class="sm">0</span> also indicates an isotope of zero, that is <span
class="sm">[0S]</span> is <i>not</i> the same as <span class="sm">[S]</span>.</p>

<p>There is no requirement that the isotope is a genuine isotope of the element.  Thus, <span
class="sm">[36Cl]</span> is allowed even though <span class="sm">[35Cl]</span> and <span
class="sm">[37Cl]</span> are the actual known stable isotopes of chlorine.</p>

<p>A general-purpose SMILES parser must accept at least three digits for the isotope and values
from <span class="sm">0</span> to <span class="sm">999</span>.</p>


<a name="3.1.3"></a><h4>3.1.3 "Organic Subset" Elements</h4>

<p>A special subset of elements called the "organic subset" of
<b>B</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>N</b>,<b>O</b>, <b>P</b>, <b>S</b>, <b>F</b>,
<b>Cl</b>, <b>Br</b>, <b>I</b>, and <b>*</b> (the "wildcard" atom) can be
written using the only their atomic symbol (that is, without the square
brackets, H-count, etc.).  When an atom is specified this way has the
following properties:</p>

<ul>

  <li>"implicit hydrogens" are added such that valence of the atom is in
  the lowest normal state for that element</li>
  <li>the atom's charge is zero</li>
  <li>the atom has no isotopic specification</li>
  <li>the atom has no chiral specification</li>
</ul>

<p>The implicit hydrogen count is determined by summing the bond orders
of the bonds connected to the atom.  If that sum is equal to a known
valence for the element or is greater than any known valence then the
implicit hydrogen count is 0.  Otherwise the implicit hydrogen count is the
difference between that sum and the next highest known valence.</p>

<p>The "normal valence" for these elements is defined as:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr><td class="ect"> Element </td> <td class="ect"> Valence </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> B </td> <td class="ec"> 3 </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> C </td> <td class="ec"> 4 </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> N </td> <td class="ec"> 3 or 5 </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> O </td> <td class="ec"> 2 </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> P </td> <td class="ec"> 3 or 5 </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> S </td> <td class="ec"> 2, 4, or 6 </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> halogens </td> <td class="ec"> 1 </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> * </td> <td class="ec"> unspecified </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>Examples:<p>

<table class="et">
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> C  </td> <td class="ec"> methane </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> N  </td> <td class="ec"> ammonia </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> Cl </td> <td class="ec"> hydrochloric acid </td> </tr>
</table>

<p><i>Note: The remaining atom properties, chirality and ring-closures, are discussed in later sections.</i></p>

<a name="3.1.4"></a><h4>3.1.4 The Wildcard '*' Atomic Symbol</h4>

<p>The '*' atom represents an atom whose atomic number is unknown or unspecified.  If it occurs
inside brackets, it can have its isotope, chirality, hydrogen count and charge specified.  If it
occurs outside of brackets, it has no assumed isotope, a mass of zero, unspecified chirality, a
hydrogen count of zero, and a charge of zero.</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> Oc1(*)ccccc1  </td> <td class="ec"> ortho-substituted phenol </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>The '*' atom does not have any specific electronic properties or
valence.  If specified outside of square brackets, it takes on the valence
implied by its bonds.  If it is inside square brackets, it takes on the
valence implied by its bonds, hydrogens and/or charge.</p>

<p>A '*' atom can be part of an aromatic ring.  When deducing the
aromaticity of a ring system, the ring system is considered aromatic if
there is an element which could replace the '*' and make the ring system
meet the aromaticity rules (see <a href="#2.7">aromaticity</a>, below).

<a name="3.1.5"></a><h4>3.1.5 Atom Class</h4>

<p>An "atom class" is an arbitrary integer, a number that has no chemical
meaning.  It is used by applications to mark atoms in ways that are
meaningful only to the application.  Multiple atoms may be labeled with the
same atom class.</p>

<p>If the atom class is not specified then the atom class is zero.
The atom class is interpreted as a number, so both "[CH2:5]"
and "[NH4+:005]" have an atom class of 5.</p>

<p>A SMILES parser must accept at least four digits for
the class number, and the values 0 to 9999.</p>


<a name="3.2"></a><h3>3.2 Bonds</h3>

<p>Atoms that are adjacent in a SMILES string are assumed to
be joined by a single or aromatic bond (see <a href="#2.7">aromaticity</a>).  For example:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> CC    </td> <td class="ec"> ethane </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> CCO   </td> <td class="ec"> ethanol </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> NCCCC </td> <td class="ec"> n-butylamine </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> CCCCN </td> <td class="ec"> n-butylamine </td> </tr>
</Table>

<p>Double and triple bonds are represented by '=' and '#', respectively:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> C=C   </td> <td class="ec"> ethene </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> C#N   </td> <td class="ec"> hydrogen cyanide </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> CC#CC </td> <td class="ec"> 2-Butyne </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> CCC=O </td> <td class="ec"> propanal </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>A single bond can be explicitely represented with '-', but it is almost never
necessary.<p>

<table class="et">
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> C-C     </td> <td class="ec"> same as: CC </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> C-C-O   </td> <td class="ec"> same as: CCO </td> </tr>
  <tr><td class="ecbc"> C-C=C-C </td> <td class="ec"> same as: CC=CC </td> </tr>
</table>

<p><i>Note: The remaining bond symbols, </i>"<tt>:.\/</tt>"<i>, are syntactically
equivalent to the single, double and triple-bond symbols (they may appear
anywhere a bond symbol is allowed), but the semantics are discussed in
later sections.</i></p>


<a name="3.3"></a><h3>3.3 Branches</h3>

<p>An atom with three or more bonds is called a <i>branched atom</i>, and is
represented using parentheses.</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="2-ethyl-1-butanol.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> CCC(CC)CO </td> <td class="ec"> 2-Ethyl-1-butanol     </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>Branches can be nested or "stacked" to any depth:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="2-4-dimethyl-3-pentanone.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> CC(C)C(=O)C(C)C </td> <td class="ec"> 2,4-dimethyl-3-pentanone</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ec">pic here<img src=""></td> <td class="ecbc"> OCC(CCC)C(C(C)C)CCC </td> <td class="ec"> 2-propyl-3-isopropyl-1-propanol </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="thiosulfate.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> OS(=O)(=S)O </td> <td class="ec"> thiosulfate </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>The SMILES branch/chain rules allow nested parenthetical expressions (branches) to an arbitrary
depth.  Some SMILES strings in standard databases contain over 30 levels of branches, and much
deeper nesting is possible.  A general purpose parser must handle at least 100 levels, and should
handle 1000 or more.  For example, the following SMILES, though peculiar, is legal:
</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ecbc">C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C(C))))))))))))))))))))C</td><td class="ec">C22H46</td> </tr>
</table>


<a name="3.4"></a><h3>3.4 Rings</h3>

<p>In a SMILES string such as "C1CCCCC1", the first occurance of a ring-closure
number (an "rnum") creates an "open bond".  When that same rnum is encountered
later in the string, a bond is made between the two atoms, which typically
forms a cyclic structure.

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="cyclohexane.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> C1CCCCC1 </td> <td class="ec"> cyclohexane</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="perhydroisoquinoline.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> N1CC2CCCC2CC1 </td> <td class="ec"> perhydroisoquinoline </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>  If a bond symbol is present between the atom and
rnum, it can be present on <i>either or both</i> bonded atoms.  However, if
it appears on both bonded atoms, the two bond symbols must be the same.</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td rowspan="3" class="ec"><img src="cyclohexane.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> C=1CCCCC=1 </td> <td class="ec"> cyclohexene</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> C=1CCCC1   </td> <td class="ec">  cyclohexene <i>(preferred form)</i> </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> C1CCCC=1   </td> <td class="ec">  cyclohexene </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ec">&nbsp;</td> <td class="ecbc"> C-1CCCC=1  </td> <td class="ec"> <i>invalid</i> </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>Ring closures must be matched pairs in a SMILES string, for example, "C1CCC"
is not a valid SMILES.</p>

<p>It is permissable to re-use ring-closure numbers.  Once a particular number
has been encountered twice, that number is available again for subsequent ring closures.<p>

<table class="et">
  <tr>
    <td class="ec" rowspan="2"><img src="dicyclohexyl.gif"></td>
    <td class="ecbc">
      C1CCCCC1C1CCCCC1
    </td>
     <td class="ec">
      dicyclohexyl
    </td>
    <td class="ec" rowspan="2">both SMILES are valid</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="ecbc">
      C1CCCCC1C2CCCCC2
    </td>
    <td class="ec">
      dicyclohexyl
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Note that the ring number zero is valid, for example cyclohexane can be
written "C0CCCCC0".<p>

<p>Two-digit ring numbers are permitted, but must be preceeded by the percent
"%" symbol, such as "C%25CCCCC%25" for cyclohexane. Three-digit numbers and
larger are never permitted.  However, note that three digits are not invalid; for
example, "C%123" is the same as "C3%12", that is, an atom with two rnum
specifications.</p>

<p>The digit(s) representing a ring-closure are interpreted as a number, not a
symbol, and two rnums match if their numbers match.  Thus, C1CCCCC%01 is a
valid SMILES and is the same as C1CCCCC1.  Likewise, C%00CCCCC%00 is a
valid SMILES.</p>

<p>A single atom can have several ring-closure numbers, such as this spiro
atom:<p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="spiro.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> C12(CCCCC1)CCCCC2 </td> <td class="ec"> name? </td> </tr>
</table>


<a name="3.5"></a><h3>3.5 Aromaticity</h3>

<a name="3.5.1"></a><h4>3.5.1 Aromaticity in SMILES</h4>

<p>Aromaticity can be represented in one of two ways in a SMILES.  The
Kekul&eacute; form is always acceptable.  For convenience and to provide a
<a href="#4">normalized form</a> for output, an atom symbol that
begins with a lowercase letter is aromatic.  For example:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="benzene.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> c1ccccc1<br>C1=CC=CC=C1 </td> <td class="ec"> benzene </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="indane.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> c1ccc2CCCc2c1<br>C1=CC=CC(CCC2)=C12 </td> <td class="ec"> indane </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="furan.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> c1occc1<br>C1OC=CC=C1<br> </td> <td class="ec"> furan </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>Aromaticity is deduced and/or confirmed by a SMILES parser.  In an aromatic system, all atoms in
the ring system must be sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized, and the number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_electron"
title="Pi_electron">Pi electrons</a> must meet
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%BCckel's_rule">H&uuml;ckel's 4N+2 criterion</a>.</p>

<p>This meaning of <i>aromaticity</i> for SMILES is strictly for
<a href="http://www.emolecules.com/doc/cheminformatics-101.htm">cheminformatics</a> purposes.  It is
<i>not</i> intended to imply anything about the physical or chemical properties of a substance.  In
many or most cases, the SMILES definition of aromaticity will match the chemist's notion of what is
aromatic, but in some cases it will not.  The SMILES definition of aromaticity is designed to
facilitate <a href="#4">normalization</a> of SMILES, not to predict chemical properties.
</p>

<a name="3.5.2"></a><h4>3.5.2 Definition of Aromaticity</h4>

<p><i>This definition of aromaticity needs considerable work.  For a good summary of the question of
aromaticity, see:</i></p>

<p style="padding-left:2em;">
<a href="http://wiki.cubic.uni-koeln.de/cdkwiki/doku.php?id=smiles_aromaticity">http://wiki.cubic.uni-koeln.de/cdkwiki/doku.php?id=smiles_aromaticity</a></p>

<p><i>The definition below is the one that Daylight has described in public meetings, but I believe
there are more subtle rules that Daylight actually use in their SMILES Toolkit. -- CJ</i></p>

<p>The formal meaning of a lowercase "aromatic" element in a SMILES string is that the atom is
in the sp<sup>2</sup> electronic state.  When generating a normalized SMILES, all sp<sup>2</sup>
atoms are written using a lowercase first character of the atomic symbol.  When parsing a SMILES,
a parser must note the sp<sup>2</sup> designation of each atom on input, then when the parsing is
complete, the SMILES software must verify that electrons can be assigned without violating the
valence rules, consistent with the sp<sup>2</sup> markings, the specified or implied
hydrogens, external bonds, and charges on the atoms.</p>

<p>This implies that the lowercase atomic symbols do <i>not</i> necessarily represent aromatic
atoms.  For example:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr>
    <td class="ec"><img src="2-4-hexadiene.gif"></td>
    <td class="ecbc"> CccccC<br>CC=CC=CC </td>
    <td class="ec"> 2,4-hexadiene<br><i>(both SMILES are valid)</i> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="ec"><img src="cyclobutadiene.gif"></td>
    <td class="ecbc"> c1ccc1<br>C1=CC=C1 </td>
    <td class="ec"> cyclobutadiene<br><i>(both SMILES are valid)</i> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="ec">&nbsp;</td>
    <td class="ecbc"> CcccC</td>
    <td class="ec"> Invalid SMILES<br>electrons can't be assigned </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Even numbers of adjacent lower case "c" or "n" are interpreted as conjugated chains. So cccc is
1,3 butadiene, Ccc is propene, C1ccccC1 is 1,3 cyclohexadiene and CnnC is azomethane.</p>


<a name="3.6"></a><h3>3.6 More about Hydrogen</h3>

<p>Hydrogens in a SMILES can be represented in three different ways:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr>
    <td class="ec">   implicit hydrogen </td>
    <td class="ecbc"> C </td>
    <td class="ec">   methane </td>
    <td class="ec">   h-count deduced from normal valence (4)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="ec">   atom property </td>
    <td class="ecbc"> [CH4] </td>
    <td class="ec">   methane </td>
    <td class="ec">   h-count specified for heavy atom</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="ec">   explicit hydrogens </td>
    <td class="ecbc"> [H]C([H])([H])[H] </td>
    <td class="ec">   methane </td>
    <td class="ec">   hydrogens represented as normal atoms</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>All three forms are equivalent.  However, some situations require that one form must be used:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Implicit hydrogen count may only be used for elements of the <a href="#2.3.3">organic elements</a> subset.</li>
  <li>Any atom that is specified with square brackets <i>must</i> have its attached hydrogens 
      explicitely represented, either as a hydrogen count or as normal atoms.</li>
</ul>

<p>A hydrogen that meets one of the following criteria must be represented as an explicit atom:</p>

<ul>
  <li>hydrogens with charge ([H+])</li>
  <li>a hydrogen connected to another hydrogen (such as molecular hydrogen, [H][H])</li>
  <li>hydrogens with more than one bond (bridging hydrogens)</li>
  <li>Deuterium [2H] and tritium [3H]</li>
</ul>

<p>It is permissible to use a mixture of an atom h-count and explicit hydrogen.  In such a case,
the atom's hydrogen count is the sum of the atomic h-count property and the number of attached
hydrogens.  For example:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> [CH4]       </td> <td class="ec"> methane </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> [H][CH2][H] </td> <td class="ec"> methane </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> [2H][CH3]C  </td> <td class="ec"> deuteroethane </td> </tr>
</table>


<a name="3.7"></a><h3>3.7 Disconnected Structures</h3>

<p>The dot '.' symbol (also called a "dot bond") is legal most places where
a bond symbol would occur, but indicates that the atoms are <i>not</i>
bonded.  The most common use of the dot-bond symbol is to represent
disconnected and ionic compounds.</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="sodium-chloride.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> [Na+].[Cl-]  </td> <td class="ec">  sodium chloride </td></tr>
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="phenol-2-amino-ethanol.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> Oc1ccccc1.NCCO   </td> <td class="ec"> phenol, 2-amino ethanol  </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="diammonium-thiosulfate.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> [NH4+].[NH4+].[O-]S(=O)(=O)[S-]      </td> <td class="ec"> diammonium thiosulfate </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>The dot can appear anywhere that a bond symbol is allowed, for example, the phenol example above
can also be written:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ec" rowspan="2"><img src="phenol-2-amino-ethanol.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> c1cc(O.NCCO)ccc1   </td> <td class="ec"> phenol, 2-amino ethanol  </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> Oc1cc(.NCCO)ccc1   </td> <td class="ec"> phenol, 2-amino ethanol  </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>The second example above is an odd, but legal, use of parentheses and the dot bond, since the
syntax allows a dot anywhere a regular bond could appear.</p>

<p>Although dot-bonds are commonly used to represent compounds with disconnected parts, a dot-bond
does <i>not</i> in itself mean that there are disconnected parts in the compound.   See the
following section regarding ring digits for some examples that illustrate this.<p>

<a name="3.8"></a><h3>3.8 Other Uses of Ring Numbers and Dot Bond</h3>

<p>A ring-number specifications ("rnum") is most commonly used to specify a ring-closure bond, but
when used with the "." dot-bond symbol, it can also specify a non-ring bond.  Two rnums in a SMILES
mean that the two atoms are bonded.  A dot-bond "." means that the atoms to which it
is adjacent in the SMILES string are <i>not</i> bonded to each other.  The following SMILES
illustrate this feature of SMILES:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ec" align="center"> CC </td> <td class="ecbc"> C1.C1  </td> <td class="ec"> ethane </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ec" align="center"> CCC </td> <td class="ecbc"> C1.C12.C2  </td> <td class="ec"> propane</td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="1-bromo-2-3-dichlorobenzene.gif"></td> <td class="ecbc"> c1c2c3c4cc1.Br2.Cl3.Cl4  </td> <td class="ec"> 1-bromo-2,3-dichlorobenzene </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>This feature of SMILES provides a convenient method of enumerating the
molecules of a combinatorial library using string concatenation.</p>

<hr>

<a name="3"></a><h3>3.9 Stereochemistry</h2>

<a name="3.1"></a><h4>3.9.1 Scope of Stereochemistry in SMILES</h4>

<p>A SMILES string can specify the cis/trans configuration around a double bond,
and can specify the chiral configuration of specific atoms in a molecule.</p>

<p>SMILES strings do <i>not</i> represent all types of stereochemistry.  Examples of
stereochemistry that cannot be encoded into a SMILES include:

<ul>
  <li>Gross conformational left or right handedness such as helicenes</li>
  <li>Mechanical interferences, such as rotatable bonds that are
  constrained by mechanical interferences</li>
  <li>Gross conformational stereochemistry such as the shape of a protein after folding</li>
</ul>


<a name="3.1.2"></a><h4>3.9.2 Tetrahedral Centers</h4>

<p>SMILES uses an atom-centered chirality specification, in which the atom's left-to-right order in
the SMILES string itself is used as the basis for the chirality marking.

<table class="et">
  <tr><td class="ec" align="center" colspan="2"><b>Tetrahedral Chirality</b></td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="ec">look from N toward C (chiral center)...</td>
    <td class="ec"> list the neighbors anticlockwise</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="ec"   rowspan="3" align="center"><img src="tetrahedral.gif"></td>
    <td class="ecbc" align="center">N[C@](Br)(O)C</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="ec"> ...or clockwise</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="ecbc" align="center">N[C@@](Br)(C)O</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>For the structure above, starting with the nitrogen atom, one "looks" toward the chiral
center. The the remaining three neighbor atoms are written by listing them in anticlockwise order using the '@'
chiral property on the atom, or in clockwise order using the '@@' chiral property, as illustrated
above.  The '@' symbol is a "visual mnemonic" in that the spiral around the character goes in the
anticlockwise direction, and means "anticlockwise" in the SMILES string (thus, '@@' can be thought of
as anti-anticlockwise).<p>

<p>A chiral center can be written starting from any of its neighbor atoms, and the choice of
whether to list the remaining neighbor in clockwise or anticlockwise order is also arbitrary.  The
following SMILES are all equivalent and all specify the exact same chiral center illustrated above:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> N[C@](Br)(O)C  </td> <td class="ecbc"> Br[C@](O)(N)C </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> O[C@](Br)(C)N  </td> <td class="ecbc"> Br[C@](C)(O)N </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> C[C@](Br)(N)O  </td> <td class="ecbc"> Br[C@](N)(C)O </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> C[C@@](Br)(O)N </td> <td class="ecbc"> Br[C@@](N)(O)C </td> </tr>
</table>

<p>If one of the neighbor atoms is a hydrogen and is represented as an atomic property of the
chiral center (rather than explicitely as [H]), then it is considered to be the first atom in the
clockwise or anticlockwise accounting.  For example, if we replaced the bromine in the illustration
above with a hydrogen atom, its SMILES would be:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ecbc">  N[C@H](O)C</td></tr>
</table>

<p><i>Note: Daylight's chirality specification is much more complete than this, and includes square
planar, octahedral, and trigonal-bipyramidal configurations.  Each of these is a assigned a symbol,
e.g. '@' is simply a shorthand for '@TH1'.  This section should be extended to include the full
chirality specification, even though most non-Daylight SMILES parsers are not capable of processing
these chiral configurations.</i></p>

<a name="3.3"></a><h4>3.9.3 Cis/Trans configuration of Double Bonds</h4>

<p>The configuration of atoms around double bonds is specified by the bond symbols '/' and '\'.
These symbols always come in pairs, and indicate cis or trans with a visual "same side" or
"opposite side" concept.  That is:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr>
    <td class="ec"><img src="trans-difluoroethene.gif"></td>
    <td class="ecbc"> F/C=C/F<br>F\C=C\F  </td>
    <td class="ec"> trans-difluoroethene<br><i>(both SMILES are equivalent)</i> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="ec"><img src="cis-difluoroethene.gif"></td>
    <td class="ecbc"> F\C=C/F<br>F/C=C\F </td>
    <td class="ec"> cis-difluoroethene<br><i>(both SMILES are equivalent)  </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The "visual interpretation" of the '/' and '\' symbol is that they are thought of as bonds that
"point" above or below the allenal carbon.  That is, "F/C=C/Br" means "The F is below the first carbon,
and the Br is above the second carbon," leading to the interpretation of a trans configuration.

<p>This notation can be confusing when parentheses follow one of the allenal carbons:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr>
    <td class="ecbc">
      F/C=C/F<br>
      C(\F)=C\F
    </td>
    <td class="ec">
      trans-difluoroethene</i>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="ecbc">
      F\C=C/F<br>
      C(/F)=C/F
    </td>
    <td class="ec">
      cis-difluoroethene
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The "visual interpretation" of the "up-ness" or "down-ness" of each single
bond is <i>relative to the carbon atom</i>, not the double bond, so the sense of the symbol changed
when the fluorine atom moved from the left to the right side of the allenal carbon atom.</p>

<p><i>Note: This point was not well documented in earlier SMILES specifications, and several SMILES
interpreters are known to interpret the '/' and '\' symbols incorrectly.</i></p>

<p>A SMILES with conflicting up/down specifications is invalid:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr>
    <td class="ecbc">
      C/C(\F)=C/F
    </td>
    <td class="ec">
      Invalid SMILES: Both the methyl and fluorine are "down" relative to the first allenal carbon.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p>It is permissible, but not required, that every atom attached to a double bond be marked.  As
long as at least two neighbor atoms, one on each end of the double bond, is marked, the "up-ness" or
"down-ness" of the unmarked neighbors can be deduced.</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr>
    <td class="ecbc">
      F/C(C)=C/F
    </td>
    <td class="ec">
      trans-difluoro configuration, position of methyl is implied
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p>Extended cis and trans configurations can be specified for conjugated allenes with an odd number
of double bonds:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> F/C=C=C=C/F  </td> <td class="ec"> trans-difluorobutatriene </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> F/C=C=C=C\F  </td> <td class="ec"> cis-difluorobutatriene </td> </tr>
</table>


<a name="3.4"></a><h4>3.9.4 Tetrahedral Allene-like Systems</h4>

<p>Extended tetrahedral configurations can be specified for conjugated allenes with an even number
of double bonds.  The normal tetrahedral rules using '@' and '@@' apply, but the "neighbor" atoms
to which the chirality refers are at the ends of the allenal system.  For example:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ec"><img src="tetrahedral-allene.gif"></td><td class="ecbc"> NC(Br)=[C@]=C(O)C </td> </tr>
</table>
  
<p>To determine the correct clockwise or anticlockwise specification, the allene is conceptually
"collapsed" into a single tetrahedral chiral center, and the resulting chirality is marked as a
property of the center atom of the extended allene system.</p>

<a name="3.9.5"></a><h4>3.9.5 Partial Stereochemistry</h4>

<p>SMILES allows partial stereochemical specifications.  It is permissible for some chiral centers
or double bonds to have stereochemical markings in the SMILES, while others in the same SMILES
string do not.  For example:</p>

<table class="et">
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> F/C=C/C/C=C\C  </td> <td class="ec"> completely specified  </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> F/C=C/CC=CC  </td> <td class="ec"> partially specified </td> </tr>
  <tr> <td class="ecbc"> N1[C@H](Cl)[C@@H](Cl)C(Cl)CC1  </td> <td class="ec"> partially specified</td> </tr>
</table>

<a name="3.9.6"></a><h4>3.9.6 Other Chiral Configurations</h4>

<p>The SMILES language supports a number of atom-centered chiral
configurations:</p>
<pre>
   TH	Tetrahedral
   AL	Allenal
   SP   Square Planar
   TB   Trigonal Bipyramidal
   OH   Octahedral
</pre>

<p>The shorthand notations '@' and '@@' correspond to clockwise and
anti-clockwise tetrahedral chirality, and are the same a '@TH1' and
'@TH2', respectively.  Likewise, in an allenal configuration, the shorthand
notations '@' and '@@' correspond to '@AL1' and '@AL2', respectively.</p>

<p>Very few SMILES systems actually implement the rules for SP, TB or OH chirality.</p>

<p><i>NEED COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION for SP, TB and OH.</i></p>

<a href="3.10"></a><h3>SMILES Strings</h3>

<p>A SMILES string is terminated by a whitespace terminator character (space, tab, newline,
carriage-return), or by the end of the string.</p>

<p>Other data or information, such as a name, properties, registration number, etc., may follow the
SMILES on a line after the whitespace character.  SMILES parsers will ignore this data, although
applications that use the SMILES parser will often make use of it.</p>
