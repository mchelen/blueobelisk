Requirements
============

The chemical structures project depends on:
- CMake >= 2.4 (see http://www.cmake.org)
- Python >= 2.2 (see http://www.pymol.org)

You can also access extended features by using:
- OpenBabel >= 2.1.1 (see http://www.openbabel.org)

Basic Installation
==================
The project can be easily compiled in 4 steps:
1. 'cd' to the directory containing the project's source code
2. Create a 'build' directory and go in this directory
2. Type 'cmake ..'
4. Type 'make install' to build and install the data files

Options
=======
By default, 'make install' will install the project's files in a default directory. You can specify another path for the installation:
'cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/another/path .'
