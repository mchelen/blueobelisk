#
# then:
#
# color atoms "byElement_Mine"
#
# RANGE min and max are ignored for byElement and byResidue schemes,
# and there is no scaling done ever, so effectively these prefixes
# make the correlated value a simple index into the array.
# This is what one would want for something that should be a given 
# for a specific element or residue

# Residue indexes in order correspond to the groupID of an atom:

# new feature: color ["schemeName"] RANGE [min] [max]
# allows setting of color range and scheme so that color
# values can be determined. This would be used for making
# a color key using positionable ECHO text boxes:
#

#
# new feature: show colorscheme "schemeName"

# along with an optional bracketed sync group identifier -- generally a random 
# number that identifies the page containing the controlling applet. If the 
# syncId is not given, then the ID for the page containing the controlling applet
# is used. This feature is important for cross-frame synchronization only.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#version=11.1.29

# code: totally reorganized isosurface code; new org/jmol/jvxl packages
#
# adds  (1) isosurface functionxy "file:data.dat" ...
# adds  (2) isosurface functionxy "functionName" {x0 y0 z0} {-ni ...} ...
# adds  (3) isosurface functionxy "functionName" {x0 y0 z0} {-ni ...}{-nj ...} ...
#
# (1) "file:" allows reading of xy data from files for graphing f(x,y)
# (2) ni<0 indicates JavaScript functionName will return a single string that
#     should be parsed for numeric data.
# (3) ni<0, nj<0 indicates that JavaScript will fill the fourth parameter
#     of the function with an array of f[nX][nY] data values:
#
# Jmol:
#
#   isosurface s1 functionXY "xyData" {-2 -2 -2} {21 0.1 0 0} {21 0 0.1 0} {21 0 0 0.1}

#
# (2) and (3) are very fast; (1) is the original method, but it is slow.
#
# MAYSCRIPT expanded
#
# for the Wiki or any application where absolutely no JavaScript
# is to be allowed, simply remove the MAYSCRIPT parameter, which
# now covers all aspects of JavaScript interaction from within Jmol
#
#
# adds   applySymmetryToBonds  (default: FALSE)
#
# applySymmetryToBonds 
#
# When set TRUE, this flag instructs Jmol when applying symmetry
# to atoms, as in "load xxx.cif {1 1 1}", to also apply symmetry
# to the bonds indicated in the file. The flag is useful when 
# normal Jmol autobonding would not properly connect atoms, but 
# the model is "molecular" -- the base atom coordinates are correct
# for whole molecules. The flag should NOT be used in cases where
# the application of symmetry operations creates new bonds that 
# were not present in the original set, as for quartz.cif, where
# there is only one bond initially, and after applying symmetry
# new bonds are created that are between atoms that were created
# using two different symmetry operations. 
#
# adds isosurface HOMO/LUMO [+/- n]
#
# better isosurface plane rendering, especially in regard to meshes
# bug fix in isosurface contour -n going WAY back to before 10.9.60
# refactoring of all isosurface-related classes
# support for Spartan MO HOMO
#
# adds isosurface POCKET [cavity] sasurface
# adds isosurface INTERIOR [cavity] sasurface
#
# adds load TRAJECTORY -- for a single file with multiple models all with
# the same number of atoms. Atom locations can also be updated on the
# fly using the data statement. 
#
# adds TRAJECTORY n command -- like FRAME or MODEL, but never more
# than one model at a time displayed, because there is only one set
# of atoms. 
#
# adds script: option for callbacks set from within Jmol. That is, callbacks
# can either be to host page JavaScript functions or to Jmol scripts. This 
# will allow interactive sessions without external JavaScript.
#   
# set pickcallback "script: script doCallback.spt"
#
# adds resizeCallback because certain positioning of echos and sizing of the 
# structure may require method intervention after the resizing   
#
# adds translucency for echo and hover, both text and backgrounds
#
# adds echo script to defined state
#
# adds hourglass cursor during MO/Isosurface operations
#
# fixes inoperative "set pickingstyle measures on"

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#version=11.1.28 

# adds
#
# a = script("some script command")
# a = javascript("some javascript")
#
# putting output into a from commands such as "show" or "getProperty", for instance.
#
# reinstates tempManager properly.
#
# adds support for CAChe CSF files with MOPAC (AM1, PM3, etc.),
# Density Functional, and Extended Huckel Gaussian/Slater-based molecular orbitals.
#
# CHANGES DEFAULT RENDERING FOR MOLECULAR ORBITALS TO: MESH NOFILL FRONTONLY
#
# adds MOPAC 2007 graphf output reader (gpt2 files, MOPAC molecular orbitals)
# based on the VERY latest version (not released yet), which includes
# "MOPAC-Graphical data" on the first line, character index 6.
#
# adds 
#
#  mo HOMO [+/- n]
#  mo LUMO [+/- n]
#
# fixes bugs found by FindBugs:
#
# labels:  default z setting for labels (set labelFront, set labelGroup, set labelAtom) 
#          was not being recorded properly
# move:    with slab or zoom was doing integer math
# GhemicalMMReader -- was incorrectly assigning aromatic to bond type 4 via fall-through of switch
#
# adds xodydata reading of "boundary" as unitcell
# enhances default axis rendering for axes unitcell
#
# adds expanded isosurface-related commands:
#
#  draw list
#  isosurface list
#  lcaocartoon list
#  (mo list) -- not particularly useful
#  pmesh list
#
# Listing gives id, number of vertices, number of polygons, visibility,
# and title (usually the command that was given that created this isosurface)
#
# CHANGED BEHAVIOR FOR ISOSURFACE COMMAND WITHOUT ID INDICATED:
#
# Now if no ID is indicated, the previous ID is used for all commands 
# EXCEPT "isosurface delete", which deletes all isosurfaces. 
#
# This is a change from Jmol 10.2 and 11.0, where if you leave
# off the ID, a new isosurface is created.
#
# This was a needed change to prevent unwanted multiple isosurfaces.
#
# CHANGED BEHAVIOR FOR ISOSURFACE DEFAULT COLOR
#
# The default isosurface color no longer changes shade among 5 possible shades.
# That was necessary only because it was easy to mistakenly make multiple
# isosurfaces that otherwise would look the same. 

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#version=11.1.27

# fixes two state bugs: 
# 1) dots/geosurface not being saved properly in state
# 2) animation parameters not being saved properly in state

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#version=11.1.26

#version=11.1.20

# cleans up axes/boundbox/unitcell business
#
# allows for individually colored axes:
#
# color axis1 ... 
# color axis2 ... 
# color axis3 ... 
# color axes ... (of course)
#
# and these objects are considered more like background -- 
# colors and sizes persist past file load
#
# to turn on and off without messing with size, just use
#
# showAxes = true
# showBoundBox = true
#
# etc.

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#version=11.1.19  

# allows comparison of user-defined atom properties in SELECT:
#
# select property_myprop < 1e-5; 
#
# and 
#
# x = {carbon}[5].property_test
# x = {carbon}.property_test.min
# x = {carbon}.property_test.max
#
# etc.
#
# This is it! :)

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#version=11.1.18

# introduces user-definable atom properties that can be used
# to color isosurfaces:
#
# x = load("file.dat");
# isosurface variable x   # simple 100% vdw radius mapping
#
# select 1.3
# data "property_myprop @x"
# isosurface property_myprop
#
# allows isosurface mapping of general atom properties:
#
# isosurface sasurface colorscheme bwr map property temperature
#
# adds "bwr" colorscheme as opposed to "rwb", which I think is backward.
#
# isosurface -- now supports APBS (  )
#               molecular electrostatic potential output files
#
# write -- modified to allow unquoted filename in 
#   write isosurface file.name

# jvxl 1.0 -- adds ANGSTROMS flag on line with # of atoms (line 3)

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

#version=11.1.17

# deprecation of SET
# ------------------
#
# The "SET" command is no longer necessary. Anything that could have
# been set using "SET x .... " can now be set using
#
#  x = ....
#
# This allows for a much cleaner interface because we simply make 
# settings in a normal sort of way:
#
# axes on
# axes = molecular
#
# measures = angstroms
#
# It will take a bit more to make it all consistent, but the idea
# is that there are then some special reserved variables that 
# mean something special when set, like "bondmode"
#
# This build allows for the applet to be "bare-bones" -- only the
# essential classes included in the Jar file; others never included
# or possibly in accompanying jar files, such as, perhaps, JmolPopupMenu.jar,
# JmolNavigation.jar, JmolBio.jar, Jm  olSurface.jar, JmolXtal.jar, etc. 
#
# Then a developer can slim down the download. The minimum is 697K, 
# about 58% of the full package. All that gets you is atoms, bonds, 
# and measures.

#    bondset    {oxygen}.bonds

# plane and bondset are new; arithmetic operations are not fully developed.

# These can be mixed and matched to good effect. Certain relatively
# intuitive rules apply. Usually the operand on the left sets
# the overall type, allowing for easy type conversion depending upon 
# operand order:
#   int + float:
#     0 + 3.6 ==> 3    (int on left rounds float on right)
#     3.6 + 0 ==> 3.6  (float on left sets result)
#
#   int/float + string:
#     0.0 + "3.5" ==> 3.5 (string converted to float)
#     0 + "3.5"   ==> 3 (string converted to float, then int)
#     "3.5" + 0   ==> "3.50" (integer converted to string)
#     "3.5" + 0.0 ==> "3.50.0" (float converted to string)
#
#     1.0 + {carbon}.xyz     ==> 1 + distance from {0 0 0} to {carbon} center
#     {carbon}.xyz + 1       ==> {carbon} center point offset by {1 1 1}
#
#     x = {carbon}.xyz * {1 0 0} ==> (dot product)
#
#     Now x is the average x coordinate of carbon
#
#  Boolean expressions are a bit different in that the operators 
#  AND, OR, XOR, and NOT all require conversion to boolean UNLESS both
#  operands are atom expressions, in which case these operate directly on the
#  atom sets and return a new atom set, just like in SELECT.
#
#     3 and 0.5  ==> TRUE (both are nonzero)
#     false OR 2.0 ==> true (2.0 is not 0, so it is TRUE)
#     {oxygen} and {molecule=1} ==> all oxygen atoms in the first molecule
#
#     x = ({oxygen} and {molecule=1}).xyz 
#
#     x is now the center point of all oxygen atoms in the first molecule
#
#  In standard math, boolean TRUE evaluates to 1.0; FALSE evaluates to 0.0
#
#     true + 2.0 ==> 3.0 ("TRUE" evaluates to 1.0 in math operations)     
#     2 + true ==> 3 ("TRUE" evaluates to 1.0 and is then turned into an integer)     
#
#
# ATOM EXPRESSION AUTOMATIC DEFINE
#
# When you set a variable to a value, and that value is a point, plane, or atom expression,
# then Jmol automatically registers the result as follows:
#
#  points:
#    x = "{x y z}"
#
#  planes:
#    x = "{x y z w}"
#
#  atom expressions:
#    x = n
#    x_set = "({i j k ...})"
#
# NOTE: "set x" removed in 11.3.40:
# NOTE: _set removed in 11.3.41:
#
#    x = {oxygen}.xyz
#    y = {carbon}.xyz
#    draw @x
#    draw @y
#    draw line1 @x @y
#
#   and
#
#    x = {carbon}[3][5]
#    select @x
#    color green

#    x = {carbon}[3][5]
#    select @x
#    color green

#
#    x = {carbon or oxygen}.bonds
#    select BONDS @x
#    color bonds green

# DATA() function and variable option for DATA command
#
# x = data({atomno < 10},"xyz")
# x = data({atomno < 10},"mol")
# x = data({atomno < 10},"pdb")
#
# data "model @x"

# write data t.xyz
# write data t.mol

#
#
# Better BITSET implementation 
#
# CHANGE: default string value for a bitset is now the ({n:m})
# string format, which can be used in numerous commands.
#
# To get the count within a string context, just use .size:
#
# x = "number selected is " + {selected}.size
#
# or force integer math:
#
# x = "number selected is " + (0 + {selected})
#
# merges math functions within(), connected(), substructure() into molecular math
#
# adds connected() both for finding atoms and for identifying bonds:
#  xAtoms = connected(3, {carbon})
#  xBonds = connected(1.3,2.5,"single", {carbon} {oxygen})
#
# adds
#  x.atoms
#  to go along with x.bonds   
#
# adds distance({carbon},{oxygen})
# adds angle({carbon}[4],{oxygen}[3], {nitrogen}[2])
#
# angle function accepts from three or four 
# atom expressions or XYZ coordinates and returns a decimal number for
# the distance, angle, or dihedral relating these points. 
# When more than one atom is involved, average positions are used. 
#
# Note that when more than one atom is involved in a set, 
# the following are different:
#
#  x1 = {molecule=1}.distance{molecule=2}
#  x2 = {molecule=1}.xyz - {molecule=2}.xyz
#
#  x1 is a NUMBER that is the "average distance measured 
#     from each molecule 1 atom to the average molecule 2 position"
#  x2 is a point representing the VECTOR from the "average position of molecule 2" 
#     to the "average position of molecule 1"
#
# The following are all equivalent:
#
#  x3 = {molecule=1}.xyz.distance{molecule=2}
#  x4 = 0.0 + ({molecule=1}.xyz - {molecule=2}.xyz)   
#  x5 = ({molecule=1}.xyz - {molecule=2}.xyz).distance{0 0 0}
#  x6 = distance({molecule=1} {molecule=2})
#
#  They are all the distance from the center of molecule 1
#  to the center of molecule 2
#
#
# x = load("filename")
#
# The string data in the file are loaded into the string.
# If the file does not exist, then the string contains the error message.
#
#
# Implements ({i j:k m n}) bitset option across all commands
#
# RESET varName
#
# reset varName  # clears that variable definition
#
#
# "UNSPECIFIED" and "QUADRUPLE" BOND TYPES
#
# An additional bond type is now avaiable: "UNSPECIFIED". 
# This shows up in the MOL2 reader and may be selected for and modified using, for example:
#
#  select connected(unspecified)
#  color bonds red
#
# or
#
#  select connected(unspecified)
#  connect (selected) single modify
#
# In addition, we now can depict quadruple bonds.

# allows measurements to be recalculated on the fly.
#
#
# MEASUREMENT FORMAT STRINGS
#
# Measurement format strings can be set using
#
# measure "format string..."
#
# where the format string may have the following keys:
#
#  %=      1-based index
#  %VALUE  the value of the measurement
#  %UNITS  the units for the measurement
#  %x1     atom property "x" for atom 1 
#  %x2     atom property "x" for atom 2
#  %x3     atom property "x" for atom 3
#  %x4     atom property "x" for atom 4

#
#
# POINTS IN IF, SET, and %{}
#
# Points in IF, SET, and %{} can be designated using the standard {x y z}
# notation WITHOUT commas. This is because we have to distinguish between
# atom expressions {1,2,3} and coordinates {x y z}, and this seems to me the
# simplest way to do it. (Comma means "or" in atom expressions.) In all other
# instances, the commas are fine, including "SET UNITCELL" and "SET DEFAULTLATTICE".

# EXPANDED MODULUS % OPERATOR IN IF, SET, AND %{}
#
# Usually modulus is reserved for integer math, so we

#  string modulus for trimming and padding
#    "test" %3  ==> left trim:  "tes"
#    "test" %6  ==> right pad:  "test  "
#    "test" %-3 ==> right trim: "est"
#    "test" %-6 ==> left pad:   "  test"   
#
#  float modulus for rounding and scientific notation
#    3.5456 %3 ==> "3.546"  (STRING!)
#    3545.6 %-3 ==> "3.55E+3" (STRING!)
#
#    0.0 + 3.5456 %3  ==> 3.546 (float)
