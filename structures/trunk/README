# Chemical-Structures: Presentation
#
The chemical-structures package aims to provide a complete set of molecular structures. The version 2.0 contains over 500 structures of organic compounds. In addition to structural data, each file contains complementary informations, like molecular weight, boiling point, melting point or InChI string.

The structures are provided in CML format, but can easily be converted to other formats by using the OpenBabel software (http://openbabel.sourceforge.net/wiki/Main_Page).

At this time, 4 languages are supported (dutch, english, french and german). New languages are easy to add (a single file to edit: l10n.xml). Structures are visualized with the Jmol applet (http://jmol.sourceforge.net/)

#
# Chemical-Structures: Data Generation
#
Each structure is generated with the ghemical software, and the best conformation is chosen by using a random conformation search and optimized with MOPAC/PM3. Additional data, like molecular weight, exact molecular weight and molecular formula are calculated with OpenBabel. InChI string are generated by the official InChI CLI tool. At least, boiling point and melting point are the mean-values of data found in scientific literature.
